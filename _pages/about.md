I received her B.C. and M.S. degrees in Computer Application Technology from Hohai University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, and Ph.D. in Mechanical Design and Theory from Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China, in 2011. From September 2014 to September 2016, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Department of Computer science, University of Surrey. Now I am a Professor in the School of Computer Science and Technology, Taiyuan University of Science and Technology. 

My areas of expertise include surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization, machine learning, and their applications in real-world problems. 

I am an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, an Associate Editor of the Engineering Application of Artificial Intelligence, and an Associate Editor of the Soft Computing Journal. I am also an Editorial Board Member of Complex and Intelligence Systems and an Editorial Board Member of Memetic Computing. 

I serve as the chair of the Intelligent Systems Application Technical Committee of IEEE CIS (2024-), and a member of the Evolutionary Computation Technical Committee of IEEE CIS. I was the chair of TF on Data-Driven Evolutionary Optimization of Expensive Problems (2016-2020).
